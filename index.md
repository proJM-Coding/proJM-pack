## What does proJM pack do?
proJM pack is a simple pack that addes helpful features to minecraft to make minecraft easier. It latches onto your pack that you use adding helful features. This does not remove any features of the pack you are using but instead adds features to your pack.

## What features do you have so far?
So far we have added this features:
- Bow stages are colour coded and have diffrent sounds per stage.
- Ore textures changed to be easier to see (also old textures).
- Clearer water.
- Alows you to see invisible players better (for bedwars).
- Lowered fire overlay hight (not added yet, still working on it).
- Diffrent sounds for explosions and bows.

## Q&A:
### Does it work for all packs?
Yes it does but it works best for 16x16 packs and packs that stick to a vanilla feel.
### Minecraft says the pack is incompatible.
Minecaft thinks that the pack is incompatible because of the bedwars feature. The pack will still work for any version it just says it will not.
### What is dither.png?
Dither.png is for 1.8.9 without it the pack will not show up in minecraft. Dither.png is also what takes care of the "super secret settings" for 1.8.9.
### How can I help?
You can help by going to the github page and making a new issue for a feature you would like or bug you found.
