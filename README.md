# proJM pack
This is a normal 16x pack to add quality of life and gameplay upgrades but with keeping the things you love from your normal pack.
Please if you have any problems with the pack or any ideas, go to the Issues tab and list it.
The MIX pack will not be edited on and it was just to test the performance impact of using it layered. 
The pack was based on zyph's pack and Fiizy's pack also. The sounds and blocks were from zyph's pack but the bow was from Fiizy's.
Please tell me about any ways to help with performance, there is a issue about it and you can talk about it there.

Current features:
Better sounds
Bow stages are colour coded
Ore textures changed to be easier to see (also old textures)
More clear water
Alows you to see invisible players better (for bedwars)

**Any ideas or features you will like please tell me!**

---**How to use**---

To use please download as a zip file and then unzip it on your computer. Then unzip the "proJM pack [§f16§bx§8].zip" file. 
Inside there will be a folder and put it in the minecraft resource pack folder:

"C:\ Users\ user\ AppData\ Roaming\ .minecraft\ resourcepacks"

I can't zip the folder normally so sorry. I will try to fix this latter.
