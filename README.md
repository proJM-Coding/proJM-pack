# proJM pack
This is a normal 16x pack to add quality of life and gameplay upgrades but with keeping the things you love from your normal pack.
Please if you have any problems with the pack or any ideas, go to the Issues tab and list it.
The MIX pack will not be edited on and it was just to test the performance impact of using it layered. 
The pack was based on zyph's pack and Fiizy's pack also. The sounds and blocks were from zyph's pack but the bow was from Fiizy's.
Please tell me about any ways to help with performance, there is a issue about it and you can talk about it there.

--**Minecraft will show the pack as "incompatible" or "for a diffrent version" it still will work on all version so far**--

Current features:

. Better sounds

. Bow stages are colour coded and have diffrent sounds per stage

. Ore textures changed to be easier to see (also old textures)

. Clearer water

. Alows you to see invisible players better (for bedwars)

. Lowered fire overlay hight (not in uploaded pack yet, still working on it).

**Any ideas or features you will like please tell me!**
