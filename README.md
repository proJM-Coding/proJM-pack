# Repo info

This is proJM's personal pack with a 16 by 16 resolution.

This pack is made to be very different from most packs.
From being made without a pack maker to not being made for looks.

Our texture pack is made to add features to any pack that you use.


# How to use

Go to to the [releases](https://github.com/proJM-Coding/proJM-pack/releases) and find the latest one. 

Under assets download the proJM pack.zip file.

Put this file in "%appdata%\.minecraft\resourcepacks" and launch minecraft.

Activate the texture pack and ignore any warnings about it being made for a different version.
